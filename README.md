# Minesweeper Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game, built with Python. The game allows the player to uncover squares on a grid, trying to avoid detonating any hidden mines. The objective of the game is to uncover all the squares that do not contain mines, without detonating any of the squares that do.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply run the `MineSweeper_2023.py` Python file and select the difficulty level. The game will display a grid of squares, with each square either being blank, containing a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it, or containing a mine. To uncover a square, click on that square. If the square you uncover contains a mine, the game is over. If the square does not contain a mine, the game will continue until either all non-mine squares have been uncovered, or a mine is detonated.

## Dependencies

The game is built with Python 3, so you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine to run the game. You can download Python 3 from the official Python website. You will also need the `tkinter` and `random` modules installed on your machine.
